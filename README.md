# Intersection and Union of All Justifications

In this repository, we provide an approach to compute the core/intersection of all justifications. Please find example code in the file: Black-box/main/java/justifications/Example.java.

Additionally, we provide two approaches to compute the union of all justifications:
- a black-box algorithm: please find example code in the file: Black-box/main/java/justifications/Example.java.
- a MUS-MEM algorithm: please find the information in the file: MUS-MEM/README.md
